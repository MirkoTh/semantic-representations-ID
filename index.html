            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure you have a good internet connection from the beginning to the end of the study.
                    Disconnections will cause problems in displaying visuals and we will not be able to use your data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Switch off your addblockers during the study. That will allow us to trace back any unexpected
                    errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not 'refresh' your browser during the study. You will have to start from the very beginning again
                    and we will not be able to use your data.

                    Some of the tasks are going to be in fullscreen mode. Please do not switch off fullscreen mode if
                    switched on because presented objects will become illegible.
